This repository contains the code and resources for a brain tumor classification project using deep learning. The study explores the impact of data augmentation and explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM, to improve performance and interpretability.

## Features
- **Multi-class Brain Tumor Classification:** Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor.
  - REF: Msoud Nickparvar. (2021). Brain Tumor MRI Dataset [Data set]. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/2645886
- **Data Augmentation:** 
  - Traditional (e.g., TrivialAugment)
  - Generative (GAN-based synthetic data)
- **Explainable AI (XAI):**
  - LIME for fidelity and feature importance analysis.
  - SHAP for sparsity and local explanations.
  - Grad-CAM for visualizing attention patterns.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Classification accuracy.
  - Explainability metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity, class-wise contrastivity).
